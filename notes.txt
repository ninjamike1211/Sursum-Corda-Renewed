Do TAA after the lighting, before post effects
You take the color you'd get originally and calculate outscattering for it (how much it fades away), then you add the inscattering from the fog

But e.g. there's lambert, disney diffuse, hammon, oren-nayar, etc.
For specular the most basic one is probably cook torrance, which itself is based on 3 semi-customizable functions
Customizable as in you can pick from multiple different options if you want, the three are fresnel (F), distribution (D) and geometry (G)
Most people just go with Schlick for fresnel, GGX for distribution and Schlick GGX for geometry
