Uniforms:
    vec3 relativeEyePosition cameraPosition - eyePosition
    vec3 playerLookVector direction of player head in world-alligned space
 
    bool is_sneaking
    bool is_sprinting
    bool is_hurt (true for short time after player gets hurt)
    bool is_invisible (true for both invisibility potion and spectator mode)
    bool is_burning
    bool is_on_ground

    ivec3 currentDate x=year, y=month, z=day
    ivec3 currentTime x=hour, y=minute, z=second
    ivec2 currentYearTime x=second passed in year, y=seconds left in year
    
    int biome
    int biome_category
    int biome_precipitation 0=no percipitation, 1=rain, 2=snow
    float rainfall 0-1 float based on biome property
    float temperature 0-1 float based on biome property
    
    Internal Stuff Probably:
        float cloudTime
    
    Beta stuff maybe (broken or non-functinoal):
        playerBodyVector (seems to be same as playerLookVector)
        heldBlockLightColor (seems to always be vec3(1,1,1))
        heldBlockLightColor2 (seems to always be vec3(1,1,1))
